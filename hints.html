				<h5>Our Last Minute Advice</h5>
					<br>

					<h2>Revision Task</h2>

					<p class="mainbodytext">
					You need to pair up with somebody doing the PACES. You will be compromised if you study alone. See patients (either organised teaching or going around yourselves) on the wards at least 2-3 times/ week and meet up regularly in the evenings or weekends to blast questions at one another. Viva technique is important. Don't give incomplete answers or expect the examiner to prise the answer out of you.
					<br>

					Example with pulmonary fibrosis short case <br>


					Examiner: What one investigation will you do to confirm your suspicion?<br>
					Candidate: CT scan<br>
					Examiner: What sort of CT scan?<br>
					Candidate: Is it high resolution CT scan?<br>
					Examiner: What are you looking for?<br>
					Candidate: Ground glass appearance?<br>
					Examiner: So what?
					</p>
					<p class="important-z">ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz - It's tedious.</p><br>

					<h2>Here's the ideal 1st response</h2>

					<p class="mainbodytext">I would arrange a high resolution CT chest to confirm the diagnosis. A ground glass appearance is associated with active alveolitis which responds well to steroids, whereas a honey combing and interstitial fibrosis indicates more advanced disease which will be less steroid-responsive.

					You only have 3 seconds to come up with something sensible, or else you will appear hesitant. The examiners will give you a clue and another if you're still stuck, by which time you will be panicking. Practice makes perfect...if you've answered a question once or twice before, the answer framework is there particularly for the more open- ended questions.

					For the station 2, make sure you take a solid history. Otherwise the examiners will just spend all the time tearing your history apart. Writing the stems like PC, HPC, PMH, all 5 systems, DH, allergies, FH and SH is useful. Ask specifics about the systems eg 'bowels alright?' is probably not good enough...better to ask about change in bowel habit, fluctuating diarrhoea/ constipation, blood, mucus etc. You will miss things otherwise.

					For station 5, briefly ask PC, HPC, PMH and DH before starting to examine within 3-4 minutes and continuing to ask other questions whilst examining. Don't forget to summarise the history/findings with the patient in stations 2, 4 and 5 and go through action plans.

					Stop seeing patients in the last week before the exam. Ideally you should take the last week off work and meet up with your partner during the daytime, and read by yourself in the evenings. You should go through the MRCP short cases book case by case, including the minutiae. For example, rheumatoid hands...describe full house presentation, differential diagnosis (psoriatic or Lyme's disease), investigations, treatment etc. Also, can I examine for cerebellar syndrome or thyroid status? If I'm asked to look at someone's face, what can it be (Cushing's, Addisons, Parkinsons, myotonia, CREST etc?

					Be confident in the exam. They can't kill you, which is always good. Even if you get it wrong, get it wrong confidently. You won't get any more points for being meek about it. You never know...you may even get away with it. The exam has changed so that the emphasis is on doing simple things well rather than focussing on the obscure and esoteric.

					Make time for relaxation...go and watch a silly film like Blazing Saddles, Life of Brian, Blades of Glory etc...or even exercise! </p><br>
